Man, just just got out of Becoming Led Zeppelin and my head is still spinning, like that mad merry-go-round ride when you’re five and feeling invincible. My back is screamin’ from those ancient theater seats that feel like they’ve been there since . . . maybe since Zeppelin's heyday themselves, creaky and unforgiving like Bonham's drum solos echoing perpetually in an attic somewhere. Popcorn crumbs are prisoners in my hoodie pocket.

> The movie opens and it's as if you're engulfed in this molten pool of sound. I swear, the speakers were turned up to eleven and rattling like the vintage amps on stage. Jimmy’s fingers dancing on strings seemed like some weird voodoo magic, made me think of those old timey circus freaks performing impossible acts. Didn't someone say we should download the movie later? Imagine capturing all that like a screech in a bottle.

Robert Plant's voice. Man, it's like silky thunder, a lion wrapped up in velvet. Weirdly like a cobra pretending to be a microwave? Yeah, I know that makes no sense, but that's what it was like. It’s like if a tornado and a lullaby had a baby on the backs of swans. And I was sitting there with Tim or was it Jim next to me, elbow deep in popcorn, asking where to watch the movie after.

> The scenes flashed by like those old train rides, rhythmic and a bit hypnotic, watching their rise from dusty English pubs to stadiums, packed sweaty crowds, faces melting into one another. Unreal. The guy next to me was snoring but it sort of blended in like an accidental bassline they forgot to cut out. You oughta try rewatching just for the ambience.

Did I mention how it hit me when the fan footage came on? Heart on a platter, soul on stage, like it was served with a side of high voltage mashed potatoes. There was a weird guy in front chewing gum like a cow, open-mouthed, but somehow it felt, I dunno, cinematic? Download the movie, get a taste of that vibe, go on.

Oops, look at this mess. Life is jumbled like that, mind a bowl of spaghetti when music hits hard. 

```
function nonsense() {
   if (led === zeppelin) {
      createMagic();
   } else {
      play(Stairway to Heaven);
   }
}
```
I don’t know, man. This is just code. Anyway.
